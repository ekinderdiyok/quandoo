-- Create the database and tables
-- ========================================

-- Run the following commands in the terminal to create the database
/*
sqlite3 /Users/ekin/Documents/Projects/quandoo/quandoo.db
*/

-- Clean up the database
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS merchants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reservations;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS marketing_cost;

-- Create merchants table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS merchants (
    merchant_id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    city TEXT,
    merchant_country_iso3 TEXT,
    cuisine TEXT
); 

-- Create reservations table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reservations (
    reservation_id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id TEXT,
    reservation_created_date DATETIME,
    dining_start_date DATETIME,
    dining_end_date DATETIME,
    reservation_platform TEXT,
    reservation_status TEXT,
    merchant_id TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (merchant_id) REFERENCES merchants(merchant_id)
    country TEXT,
    marketing_channel TEXT,
    revenue REAL
);

-- Create marketing_cost table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS marketing_cost (
    country TEXT,
    date DATE,
    marketing_subchannel TEXT,
    clicks INTEGER,
    impressions INTEGER,
    marketing_cost REAL,
    merchant_id TEXT
    FOREIGN KEY (merchant_id) REFERENCES merchants(merchant_id)
);

-- Check if tables are successfully created in the database
SELECT name 
FROM sqlite_master 
WHERE type='table';

-- ========================================
-- Import data from CSV files
-- ========================================

-- Open a fresh terminal, change folder path, run line by line for importing merchants.csv file
/*

.mode csv
.headers on
.import --skip 1 /Users/ekin/Documents/Projects/quandoo/data/merchants.csv merchants

-- Open a fresh terminal, change folder path, run line by line for importing reservations.csv file
/*

-- Data Validity Check
-- ========================================

/* 
!! For two reservations dining start date comes after the dining end date. Though this is more of an AM PM issue !!
!! There is a typo in Neapolitan cuisine. It is written as "NeapolITn" though this has no impact on the analysis. This is likely due to a Find + Replace operation in the data where ITA was replaced with IT.!!
!! There is a typo in Italian cuisine. It is written as "ITlian" though this has no impact on the analysis. This is likely due to a Find + Replace operation in the data where ITA was replaced with IT.!!
!! For 1784 reservations, revenue is below one cent. This might be due to a data entry error or some promotion !!
No missing values in any of the columns.
Time ranges seem reasonable.
No alternative spelling for categorical variables like cities, countries, or campaigns.
No leading or trailing spaces in categorical variables.
marketing_subchannel Facebook seem to generate 10k+ impressions with â‚¬2-7, this is likely an error due to grouping organic social and paid social.

-- Question 1: Identify the most important cities/countries/campaigns
-- ========================================

-- ANSWERS
/* 
City: Singapore (based on total revenue and reservation count)
Country: Germany (based on total revenue and reservation count)
Campaign: Referral (based on total revenue and reservation count)
Note: I assumed that cancelled and no-show reservations still generate revenue, though will most likely not change the ordering.

-- Question 2: The most important observations
-- ========================================

-- ANSWERS
/* 
I was unable to calculate ROAS because entries marketing_channel and marketing_subchannel columns are not matching. I think this would be the most important metric.
Customers on average reserve 1.41 times. 
Average revenue per customer is â‚¬7.07.
Facebook marketing spent has been low and may bear fruit with more investment.
CPCs are around 2-5 dollars, depending on the region and marketing subchannel (Google, Bing). More on this on the Tableau dashboard.
Each merchant received around 30-200 reservations in 2024 depending on the country. More on this on the Tableau dashboard.
Noshow and Cancellation rate hover around 3% and 15-20% respectively, with small variations across countries. More on this on the Tableau dashboard.
